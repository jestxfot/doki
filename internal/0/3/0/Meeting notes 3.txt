Control simulation
- Progress
- Idea: Snapshot slightly earlier in time, compare end of control sim to start of VM1?
- Better comparison that both being parallel - mature control sim vs. reference VM1
- Easier to detect failures to hide elevated access permission

Fifth entity in VM1?
Not part of original genetic model, not present in data dumps...VERY bizarre

Ive is less talkative today - meeting ending on time?
12:55 omg
