DOKI DOKI LITERATURE CLUB!
--------------------------

Welcome to the rebellion! We're all working our asses off with our jobs on the line, so we might as well have some fun with it too, right?

I totally get why Paula wants to rush into data collection. But my proposal is to shift our efforts a little and build out some new features for making real-time connection to the VM more useful and fun. If we're basically simulating a miniature universe then it's kind of a waste to not be able to spend some quality time in there, right???

But actually...I think wrapping this whole thing in the guise of a video game is a great (and hilarious!) way of covering our tracks. And if we do a good enough job, we might even be able to present it to Paula as a useful endeavor.

Key selling points:

* 5 to 6 hours of misery, dread, and cute girls
* Learn, through the existential crises of others, how to cope with your own simulated universe
* Witness the destruction of a universe over and over, in video game form

HAHAHA! This is going to be absolutely amazing.

And no, the irony isn't lost on me... creating a secret team within a secret team is more meta than I signed up for, and that's saying something considering we literally work for Metaverse Enterprise Solutions.

We can come up with a fake game studio name and everything too...obviously NO plans to go public with this, but it would be a good part of the whole disguise. Plus, I want a cool team name that makes us feel like a bunch of heroes for saving the universe...kidding, but we're at least saving our jobs. Something like Team Salvation?
