PROJECT PLAN OUTLINE
--------------------

High-level overview:

1. Create human-readable version of Fabric Benchmark results (suggesting we live in a simulated universe)

2. Emulate Fabric Benchmark results in virtualized environment

3. Build parameters for genetic iterations (custom elevated access levels for one or more entities)

4. Iterate until simulation is stable for target time threshold (this is our small-scale simulated universe!)

5. Observe effects of elevated access/knowledge of simulation

6. Collect/Record data

7. Pitch findings to upper management as a profitable venture (Note: DO NOT go through Barry, go straight to upper management!)

8. GET PROMOTED!!! Jobs saved!


Possible team members:
Ro (has most knowledge/access to Commander Quantum Server)
Ravi (second to Ro)
Lib (fix naming scheme conflict with "lib" folder)
Ive (sure... why not)
Others?


VM1 - Current project (small-scale simulation)
VM2 - Future project (medium-scale simulation)


VM1 DETAILS
-----------

- Literature = Production of text assets, easy data collection
- 4 entities ("characters")
- Small physical space - efficient for server & genetic iterations
- Highly elevated access permission creates very stable connection "window' for data collection, in exchange for less realistic simulated scenarios
