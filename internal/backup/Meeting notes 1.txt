Updated development timeline
New tasks:
- Test cases for new genetic model
- Server time optimization idea
- Automatic data collection?

Data migration to encrypted file share Monday

VM2 roadblocks - Ro on VM2, everyone else on VM1 for data collection

Idea for data search types:
- Visual renders
- Audio data
- VM environment changes?
- Persistent variable tampering? Timestamps?
- Parsing thought patterns? No - excessive server time needed

Meeting over time - you-know-who went on too many tangents again
I need to be more assertive about staying focused...
